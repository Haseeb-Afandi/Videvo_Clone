        <h1 class="title">License Types and Usage: Full Guide</h1>
        
        <p> Welcome to our guide on licensing and the usage of clips on Videvo.net. Below you will find all the information you need to ensure you are using clips from Videvo correctly, and not breaking any rules in the process. Firstly, it is important to point out that we license clips on Videvo in a number of different ways, and there are some clips on Videvo that you may not be able to use for certain types of project. Furthermore, you may have to credit the author of the clip. In this article we will cover the different types of license, usage, and how to credit the author if it is required.</p>
        <h3>Where can I find license and author information for a clip?</h3>
        <p> License, Usage and Author information for each clip is displayed on the clip download page in the top section to the right-hand side of the video player. Please see the image below for reference:</p>
        <p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/5e39b87904286364bc94d98f/file-rmBvFETsio.jpg" style="width: 547px;"></p>
        <h3>The difference between licence and usage</h3>
        <p> It is important to note that on Videvo we differentiate between license and usage. Broadly speaking, the license defines what permissions you have in terms of editing the clip, whether you need to provide a credit, where you can publish the clip and so on. Usage dictates whether or not you may use the clip for commercial purposes to promote a product, brand, or service. If the usage states “All projects and media” you may use the clip for commercial purposes. If it states “Editorial Use Only”, you may not use the clip for commercial purposes. You can find information on the difference between <a href="{{ url('/')}}//blog/editorial-usage-a-complete-guide-to-using-footage-marked-editorial-use-only/">Commercial and Editorial content here</a></p>
        <h3>Royalty-Free License</h3>
        <p> This is our most common license and applies to both free and premium clips. It means that once you download the clip, you may use it&nbsp;in as many projects as you like, forever. It's yours to keep, but this does not mean you "own" the clip; the copyright remains with the creator. There are no limitations on where you can publish your work (e.g. online, broadcast etc.), but be aware that if it has been marked as Editorial Use Only, you can not use it in a commercial project (to promote a product or service). See our guidelines on "Editorial Use Only" content.</p>
        <p> Royalty-Free License overview:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Download once and use in as many projects as you like</li>
        <li>You can edit the clip(s) in any way you like</li>
        <li>You are not required to credit the author of the clip(s)</li>
        <li>You may use and publish the clip(s) worldwide and on any platform, including web, broadcast, shows, theatre, apps, and games</li>
        <li>You may NOT redistribute the clip(s) in their original form (e.g. making the clip available as a stock clip for download on another website)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Videvo Attribution License</h3>
        <p> This license allows for the use of the clip free of charge for perpetuity, but you must provide a credit to the original author of the clip. For more information about how to credit, scroll down this article to the section “How to provide a credit”. Similar to the Royalty Free License, you may not redistribute the clip(s) in their original form on other platforms or services, for example, torrent websites or other stock agencies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You may use the clip(s) for free and for perpetuity</li>
        <li>You must credit the author of the clip(s) in your production</li>
        <li>You may use and publish the clip(s) worldwide and on any platform, including web, broadcast, shows, theatre, apps, and games</li>
        <li>You may not redistribute the clip(s) in their original form (download and then re-upload the clip(s) elsewhere, e.g. torrent websites)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creative Commons 3.0 Unported (CC-BY)</h3>
        <p> This is similar to the Videvo Attribution License, but you are free to distribute the clip elsewhere in its original, unedited form. You must attribute the original author in all productions as well as any distribution channels in which the clip been made available for download. This license also allows for commercial use, although special attention should be paid to ensure that no identifiable persons, brands or private property appear&nbsp;in the clip(s)&nbsp;unless a model/property release has first been obtained.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You may use the clip(s) for free and for perpetuity</li>
        <li>You must credit the author of the clip(s) in your production</li>
        <li>You may use and publish the clip(s) worldwide and on any platform, including web, broadcast, shows, theatre, apps, and games</li>
        <li>You may share, adapt, and redistribute the clip(s), but you may not sell the clip(s)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> This is a rough overview of the CC 3.0 guidelines. For full information, read the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC 3.0 Guidelines here</a></p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Usage: Commercial Use or Editorial Use Only</h3>
        <p> As we mentioned above, “Usage” defines whether a clip can be used for commercial purposes (all projects and media), or for editorial projects only (Editorial Use Only). On the clip download page, under “Usage” you will see one of two variations: “All projects and media” or “Editorial Use Only”. The screenshots below illustrate this:</p>
        <p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/5e39b9c62c7d3a7e9ae73984/file-6xazzOUzzO.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
        <div>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Scenario 1: “All projects and media”. You may use the clip for commercial purposes. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/5e39b9fb2c7d3a7e9ae73987/file-iGQiXLEJ4g.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;"> </p>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Scenario 2: “Editorial Use Only”. You may not use the clip commercially. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
        </div>
        <p> Why do we make this distinction? Clips are normally marked as Editorial Use Only when they contain identifiable persons, private property that is the main focus of the shot, brands or logos that are the main focus of the shot, or artwork or copyrighted works. Without a release form from the person(s) appearing in the shot or the owner of the property, it is not possible to use the clip for commercial purposes. However, you may use the clip for editorial purposes.</p>
        <h3>What does “Editorial” mean and what projects are classed as Editorial?</h3>
        <p> Editorial content is defined as content that is newsworthy or documentary-worthy, that is providing a commentary on a story outside of a promotional context. For example, all news programming is considered editorial, because it is providing a commentary on real-world events as they happen. Documentaries are considered editorial, providing that the aim of the documentary is not to promote a brand product or service. Even if you are selling your documentary, it is still classed as editorial.&nbsp;Editorial images can also be used for educational purposes, providing the educational content is presented as a learning aid and is factual.</p>
        <p> Read our <a href="{{ url('/')}}//blog/editorial-usage-a-complete-guide-to-using-footage-marked-editorial-use-only/">full guide on editorial use here</a>.</p>
        <p> Here are some useful guides on the topic of editorial images/videos and intellectual property:</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Does cancelling your subscription effect your license?</h3>
        <div>
        &nbsp;Any clips that you download during your subscription are still subject to the same license conditions after you cancel. So you can continue to use the content under the same conditions and there is no need to stay subscribed.&nbsp;
        </div>
        <p> Your premium subscription just gives you access to download that premium content in the first place.</p>

        <h1 class="title">How do I provide attribution?</h1>
        
        <p> Many clips on Videvo require that you provide a credit to the author (also referred to as <em>attribution</em>). These are clips that have been licensed under the Videvo Attribution License or Creative Commons 3.0 Unported (CC-BY). License and author information are viewable on the download page.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>The format</h3>
        <p> You should credit the name of the author exactly as it appears on the download page, followed by <a href="http://www.videvo.net">www.videvo.net</a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <section class="callout dashed">
        <p> For example if the author name is "Beachfront", the credit should read:&nbsp; <strong>"Stock footage provided by Beachfront, downloaded from </strong><a href="http://www.videvo.net" "=""><strong>www.videvo.net"</strong></a></p>
        </section>
        <p> For broadcast, the end credits section for stock content is often referred to as Archive, with each provider/artist on a separate line. In this instance, the credit should go on a single line in the following format "Videvo.net: &lt;author name&gt;". In the above example this would read "Videvo.net: Beachfront". If the author is Videvo, the credit should simply read "Videvo".</p>
        <h3>Where to display the credit?</h3>
        <p> The credit can be displayed in the end credits of your production, and/or a text description published alongside your video (for example, the YouTube video description) with an active hyperlink for <a href="http://www.videvo.net">www.videvo.net</a>.</p>
        <h3>Crediting the author for Creative Commons 3.0 Clips</h3>
        <p> Creative Commons outline their own guidelines on how to credit the author of media licensed under CC 3.0 (CC-BY). You can read the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chart" target="_blank">guidelines here</a></p>

        <h3>What happens to my Premium downloads after I cancel my subscription?</h3>
        <p>Any clips that you download during your subscription are still subject to the same license conditions after you cancel. So you can continue&nbsp;to use the content under the same conditions and there is no need to stay subscribed. Your Royalty Free clips will stay Royalty Free, and not revert to their previous license.</p>
        <p>Your remaining unused credits will be removed from your account upon the reversion of your account to the free plan, so you will want to ensure that you have used up any remaining credits before this point.&nbsp; Please ensure you have backed up any downloaded content as you will not be able to redownload premium content after your account reverts to the free plan.</p>

        <p> Here are some instances in which we can offer you a full refund:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you have not managed to find any useful content for your project, and you have not used your download credits</li>
        <li>If there is a bug or glitch on the website that prevents you from downloading content, and we are unable to fix the issue</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>What if I have forgotten to cancel my subscription?</h4>
        <p> Unfortunately we do not offer refunds if you forget to cancel your subscription. However, if the account has been inactive for some time, but payments have been made, we will assess the possibility of a refund on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="title">Installing Templates in DaVinci Resolve</h1>
        
        <h1>How to Install Videvo Templates Using DaVinci Resolve</h1>
        <p> Templates are a fantastic way to add a dynamic edge to your edit and with so many professionally designed templates out there, there’s almost no limit to what you can create.</p>
        <p> These pre-made and customisable templates can be incorporated into your own footage to create a style you can use consistently thereafter.</p>
        <p> In this guide we’ll take you through the steps to install templates in DaVinci Resolve.</p>
        <p> You can download a range of Videvo templates here: <a href="{{ url('/')}}/davinci-resolve-templates/">{{ url('/')}}/davinci-resolve-templates/</a></p>
        <p> Before get started we recommend you use the latest version of DaVinci Resolve if you run across any issues.</p>
        <h3><strong>Method 1 - Fusion Template Bundles .DRFX files</strong></h3>
        <p> If you’re using DaVinci Resolve 17 or higher and the template you’d like to install is a .DRFX file then the new way of doing this is a game changer!</p>
        <p> Simply download the template and click on the .DRFX file where a box will appear in DaVinci asking if you want to install your template. Click install and the media will appear in your Media Effects window.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;If you’re using any other file type or a previous version of Resolve, read on.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>Method 2 - Converting Macros (.settings files) into .DRFX files</strong></h3>
        <p> This sounds really complicated but I promise you it’s super simple. What we’ll do here is create a file structure, compress it, rename the extension and then kick back and relax.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 1: download your template and have your .setting files at the ready.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 2: Using your OS file explorer such as Finder, anywhere on your system, create a new folder called ‘Edit’ and enter it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Next, create 4 new sub folders called:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Titles</li>
        <li>Transitions</li>
        <li>Generators</li>
        <li>Effects&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>TIP: you only need to create subfolders for the items you’d like to place inside each template. But if you’re not sure what you need, just create all 4 for now.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Step 3: Place your .setting files loose in their relevant folder. Place .setting files that belong to Titles in the Titles subfolder, place .setting files that belong to Effects in the Effects folder and so on. If you’re unsure, you can identify what type each setting file is by looking at the Tutorial video the template came with.</p>
        <p> <strong>TIP: Don’t create or place additional subfolders in the Titles, Transitions, Generators, Effects subfolders.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Step 4: After you’ve copied everything you’d like to convert into the file structure, delete subfolders which don’t contain anything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 5: Navigate to the ‘Edit’ folder. With this selected, compress this folder using your OS .zip compression utility to create a .zip file of the directory structure. Rename the .zip file in your OS with the .DRFX extension instead of .zip. You can also rename Edit part to something more memorable. Now you should have a .DRFX file, double click this which will prompt DaVinci Resolve open the package contents and install- done!</p>
        <p> <strong>TIP: If you receive a warning that the .DRFX file was not imported properly, double check your file structure. Ensure the ‘Edit’ folder is zipped and that subfolders are spelt correctly.&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <h1 class="title">Using Templates in Final Cut Pro X</h1>
        
        <h1>TUTORIAL: HOW TO INSTALL TEMPLATES USING FINAL CUT PRO X</h1>
        <p> Templates are professionally designed, pre-animated elements that can elevate your edit in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;They’re used by everyone from beginners to professionals who want to speed up the editing process and deliver a high production value project. In this guide we’ll take you through the easy steps to install Final Cut Pro X templates.</p>
        <p> Please note, that as Final Cut Pro X is software made for Apple Mac computers, this guide does not apply for PC users. &nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 1: Download Template</h4>
        <p> Download your template from the Videvo template library: www.videvo.net/video-editing-templates/</p>
        <p> In your downloads folder (or wherever you set your files to download to), you should see a zip file. Double click the file to un-zip it.</p>
        <h4>Step 2: Navigating to the Movies Folder</h4>
        <p> Now that you have downloaded your chosen asset next we are essentially just dragging and dropping it into the right folder so FCPX knows where it is.<br> <br> We recommend opening two finder windows and aligning them side by side. On the left open a finder window&nbsp;(<strong>Cmd+N</strong>)&nbsp;and navigate to your&nbsp;Downloads&nbsp;folder to find the chosen asset already downloaded and unzipped.</p>
        <p> On the right, open another finder window&nbsp;(<strong>Cmd+N</strong>). Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Go</strong>&nbsp;in the tool bar and select&nbsp;<strong>Home&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>Movies</strong>.</p>
        <p> Once in the Movies folder you will see the&nbsp;<strong>Motion Templates&nbsp;</strong>Folder, open this folder to reveal 4 more folders:<em>&nbsp;Effects, Generators, Titles and Transitions</em>. After this, skip to step 4. If you do not see a Motion Templates folder, don’t worry, go to step 3.</p>
        <h4>Step 3: Creating FCPX folders manually (for non Apple Motion users)</h4>
        <p> If you don’t see a Motion Templates folder in Movies then that’s just because you don’t have a program called Apple Motion on your machine. This is nothing to worry about because you do not need Motion to use Videvo templates. Instead, we just need to create the folder with its sub folders.</p>
        <p> When in the&nbsp;<strong>Movies&nbsp;</strong>folder, navigate to File&gt; New Folder in the taskbar or use shortcut&nbsp;<strong>Shift+Cmd+N</strong>.&nbsp;Call this new folder&nbsp;<em>Motion templates.localized</em></p>
        <p> When you rename this folder you’ll notice that the .localized part disappears, this is normal. The ending (extension) is essential for FCPX to find the folder so double check the spelling.</p>
        <p> Open the new Motion Templates folder and create 4 new folders inside.</p>
        <p> Rename each folder with the following:</p>
        <p> <em>Effects.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Generators.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Titles.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Transitions.localized</em></p>
        <p> As with before, the .localized part of the structure will disappear when you deselect the folder.</p>
        <p> Now you’re all set up to proceed to step 4.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 4: The Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p> The final stage is to simply put your downloaded template in the right folder depending on whether it is an effect, generator, title or transition. If you’re not sure what the template is then we can easily work that out by looking inside the file at the extension.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>In your&nbsp;<strong>Downloads&nbsp;</strong>folder, find the downloaded template folder.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Open the folder, if you find another set of folders, open one of them to get to the contents.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>You should see a file with the title of the template usually with a black icon next to it. Select it and use&nbsp;<strong>Cmd+I</strong>&nbsp;to bring up the info window or&nbsp;<strong>File&gt; Get Info</strong>.</li>
        <li>Looking at the Name &amp; Extension sub-heading you should see one of the following: .moef, .motn, .moti, .motr&nbsp;</li>
        <li>This extension determines where the entire folder belongs, see below:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>Files with .motr go in the transitions folder</li>
        <li>Files with .motn go in the generators folder</li>
        <li>Files with .moef go in the effect folder</li>
        <li>Files with .moti go in the titles folder</li>
        </ul>
        <p> From this, you should now know where the&nbsp;<strong>entire folder</strong>&nbsp;is going to go. To clarify, it is the entire templates folder, the whole branch that needs to be dragged and dropped into relevant folder, not the individual file we checked the extension of.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 5: Organising your files</h4>
        <p> Once you’ve identified where the folder will go, it’s a great time to begin organising, this will make your experience in Final Cut a lot easier.</p>
        <p> Once you’re in the relevant folder where the template belongs, before copying it over, create a new folder and call it something memorable to organise your FCPX panels for example&nbsp;<em>Videvo Templates.</em></p>
        <p> Enter the new folder (Videvo Templates) and place the templates folder here.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Finally, open Final Cut Pro X to find your brand new template in the relevant titles, generators, effects or transitions folder. Voila!&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Pro Tip:&nbsp;Renaming templates</strong></p>
        <p> If you’re finding it hard to distinguish what each template does because they are titled as sequence numbers such as: 01, 02, 03 etc in Final Cut Pro then you can easily rename the files to better represent what each asset does.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Open a finder window, click&nbsp;<strong>Go&nbsp;</strong>in the taskbar then&nbsp;<strong>Home&gt; Movies&gt; Motion Templates</strong></p>
        <p> Click into the folder of the corresponding template element then click into the sub folder such as Videvo Templates if you created one.</p>
        <p> Next, click into the folder of the element you’d like to change and find the motion extension file, this is the file which needs to be renamed in order for the title to appear in FCPX.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> For example let’s say I’m trying to rename a transition element called Bright Shake Transition.</p>
        <p> Once in the&nbsp;<strong>Motion Templates</strong>&nbsp;folder click on&nbsp;<strong>Videvo templates</strong>&nbsp;(or whatever you called this folder) click into Bright Shake Transitions. Within this folder may be several other folders, click into the first to reveal the contents. You should see a .motr file in this transition folder, this can be renamed to something more memorable such as ‘bright shake 01’. Don’t forget you can use&nbsp;<strong>Cmd+I</strong>&nbsp;to get info on the file and check the extension.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> We recommend going through each sub folder and adding your memorial text so when you open FCPX you can have a list of easily recognisable assets such as: Bright shake 01, bright shake 02, bright shake 03 and so on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Organising folders</strong></p>
        <p> We showed you how to create a subfolder titled ‘Videvo Templates’ but you could also create sub folders based on genre, project, brand or licence type. This step is really useful for professionals who may have multiple branded elements or for anyone who has an extensive library of templates.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Creating a backup&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> As your template library grows so does its value, make sure you set reminders to back up your precious library as this Motion Templates folder sits outside of Final Cut Pro libraries and can be easily missed.</p>
        <p> <strong>Issues with using a template?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Occasionally corrupt files create caching issues which may mean your template doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to in FCPX. In this case, try deleting render files including optimised media and proxy files. When in Final Cut Pro, with the Library or Event selected in the inspector window go to File &gt; Deleted generated render files. Check ‘delete render files’, ‘delete optimised media’ and ‘delete proxy media’ and select ok.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> This does not delete your media, the files that are deleted here are ‘thinking’ files which can be re-created by FCP in the background.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="title">Using Templates in Adobe Premiere Pro</h1>
        
        <h1> <strong>How to Install Templates Using Premiere Pro</strong></h1>
        <p> Templates are a great way of increasing the production value of your project and with Videvo’s vast template library you’ve got lots to choose from.</p>
        <p> In this tutorial we’ll take you through the various methods of how to import these assets into Premiere Pro plus some editing tips to get you going.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> <strong>Method 1: The fastest way for .prproj files only</strong></h4>
        <p> After you’ve downloaded your chosen template, you’ll need to unzip the compressed file. Next open the file’s contents to reveal a folder called ‘premiere pro’, enter this to find a file with extension .prproj. Simply double click this file or right click&gt; Open with Adobe Premiere Pro and the template will open in Premiere Pro. Depending on your version of Premiere, it may ask to convert the template for use in your current version, click ok.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> <strong>Method 2: For .MOGRT Motion Graphics files</strong></h4>
        <p> Depending on your version of Premiere you can either click on the Graphics &amp; Titles option in the toolbar and select the second option , ‘Install Motion Graphics Template…’ where you can find the .MOGRT file and click open.</p>
        <p> Alternatively when in Premiere, select the Graphics workspace tab and navigate to the ‘essential graphics’ panel. If you can’t see this, go to ‘window’ in the task bar and check ‘essential graphics’ from the menu. At the bottom right of this panel you should see a little plus symbol, click it to add a single .MOGRT motion graphics file.</p>
        <p> Want to add multiple .MOGRTs? Then keep reading!</p>
        <h4> <strong>Method 3: Importing multiple .MOGRT files at once</strong></h4>
        <p> To add multiple .MOGRT files into Premiere at once you’ll need to add them to your local templates folder which is also known as your Motion Graphics Templates folder. Where that is located depends on your operating system, see below for the relevant path:&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong> Mac&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> username/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/Motion Graphics Templates</p>
        <p> <strong> Windows</strong></p>
        <p> root://Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Common/Motion Graphics Templates</p>
        <p> This Motion graphic templates folder contains all the templates within your Premiere Pro. Once located all you need to do is click and drag your multiple .MOGRT files into this folder.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> You may notice some sub-folders here, these are from previous versions of Premiere and so you do not need to place your .MOGRTs in these. The organisation of templates has actually changed in Premiere but more on that later.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Now when you open Premiere Pro, you will see these newly added .MOGRTs in the essential graphics window.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> For windows users, you can also try dragging and dropping a group of .MOGRTs directly into the essential graphics window.</p>
        <h4> <strong>Method 4: Importing .prfset Effect Preset files files</strong></h4>
        <p> .prfset files are Effect Preset files which can alter motion, opacity and time remapping amongst other awesome things. Fortunately adding them is very simple, in Premiere, navigate to the Effects panel. You can also find this in ‘window’ in the toolbar and check ‘effects’ in the list. In the list of presets that come with Premiere, you should see a sub-folder called ‘presets’ usually at the top, right hand click this and click ‘import presets’. Search to find your .prfset file and click open.</p>
        <p> In the preset folder you now should see a sub-folder with the name of your chosen template, in this you will find all your downloaded presets. Simply drag and drop your chosen effect onto an asset in your timeline for it to apply the change.</p>
        <h4> <strong>Pro tips&nbsp;</strong></h4>
        <p> <strong> Backing up&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> As your template collection grows, so does its value. Mistakes can happen and so it's a great idea to periodically backup your Motion Graphics Templates folder as located in method 3.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong> Searching</strong></p>
        <p> If you’ve recently upgraded your Premiere Pro you may notice that the way in which you locate a specific template has changed. In v22.0 you now have a handy search bar option to sift through your library as well as a check box option to search your local templates only.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The libraries check box option is great for those using brand assets that are either working from a centrally located library or perhaps just a place where you like to keep everything relating to that brand separate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong> Renaming and keywording templates</strong></p>
        <p> In the essential graphics window, locate the template you wish to change using the search options. At the bottom of each thumbnail on the right hand side you will see an ‘i’ info icon, click this to open options to let you rename the template and add keywords, a great way to optimise your search results.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="title">Using MOGRT Templates in Adobe After Effect and Premiere Pro</h1>
        
        <h1>HOW TO INSTALL MOGRT TEMPLATES IN ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS AND ADOBE PREMIERE PRO</h1>
        <p> Templates are a great way of increasing the production value of your project and with Videvo’s vast template library you’ve got lots to choose from.</p>
        <p> In this tutorial we’ll take you through the various methods of how to import motion graphics templates (also known as .MOGRT files) into Premiere Pro and After Effects, which ever program you choose!</p>
        <h2>Using MOGRT Templates in After Effects</h2>
        <p> Installing .MOGRTs into After Effects couldn’t be easier, its practically a double click and open approach. First, unpack the zip folder from your chosen downloaded template asset. Launch After Effects and navigate to File &gt; Open Project.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> A browser window will open, locate your .MOGRT file and click open. At this point After Effects will prompt you to import, click import. Now you’ll find your template files in the project panel ready to work on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> This will open your template asset as an individual file to be worked on in isolation from your main timeline project in your chosen video editing software. This is great for personalising the timing and changing the general look of each template.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Using MOGRT Templates in Premiere Pro</h2>
        <h4> <strong>Method 1: For .MOGRT Motion Graphics files</strong></h4>
        <p> Depending on your version of Premiere you can either click on the Graphics &amp; Titles option in the toolbar and select the second option , ‘Install Motion Graphics Template…’ where you can find the .MOGRT file and click open.</p>
        <p> Alternatively when in Premiere, select the Graphics workspace tab and navigate to the ‘essential graphics’ panel. If you can’t see this, go to ‘window’ in the task bar and check ‘essential graphics’ from the menu. At the bottom right of this panel you should see a little plus symbol, click it to add a single .MOGRT motion graphics file.</p>

        <p> Here is a breakdown of how they work:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>When you sign up for Videvo Lite, you receive 5 download credits for every month you subscribe.&nbsp;These can be used to download <strong>ONLY Premium videos.&nbsp;</strong></li>

        <li>Unused download credits accumulate each month up to a maximum of 100.</li>
        <li>You can buy extra credits if you run out before your next month's payment. You will be prompted both by email and in your Account Settings area when you are running low.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Download credits can not be exchanged or transferred once they are credited to your account. If you cancel your Premium subscription you will lose your download credits.&nbsp;</p>

        <p> You can cancel your Premium subscription any time after signing up with just a few simple clicks. Here are the steps:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Log in to your account and head over to your Account Settings page. This is accessible from the dropdown on your account icon in the top right corner of the website.<br><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/621fa24b2ce7ed0fb0911366/file-XQwk3LMT2m.png" style="width: 442px;"></li>
        <li>On your Account Settings page, find the section called "Plan details". To the right of this, there is a link labelled "Manage plan". Click on this.<img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/60ba53e3d656bf05f300b922/file-z0tMXlRKkq.png" style="width: 448px;"></li>
        <li>After clicking Manage plan, you will be take to a page with the various package options. To cancel your Premium subscription, choose the "Downgrade to Free" option.&nbsp;<img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5d1c717d2c7d3a5cd38e7245/images/60ba5428f6392f0aaff51e4c/file-81H9DBqOaU.png" style="width: 453px;"></li>
         <li>All done! Your account will automatically be downgraded to Free at the end of your billing cycle.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Please note, that any unused download credits will be lost once the downgrade of your account is complete, however any clips that you download during your subscription are still subject to the same license conditions after you cancel. So you can continue to use the content under the same conditions and there is no need to stay subscribed.&nbsp;</p>

        <p> In this tutorial we’ll take you through the various methods of how to import these assets into Premiere Pro plus some editing tips to get you going.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> <strong>Method 1: The fastest way for .prproj files only</strong></h4>
        <p> After you’ve downloaded your chosen template, you’ll need to unzip the compressed file. Next open the file’s contents to reveal a folder called ‘premiere pro’, enter this to find a file with extension .prproj. Simply double click this file or right click&gt; Open with Adobe Premiere Pro and the template will open in Premiere Pro. Depending on your version of Premiere, it may ask to convert the template for use in your current version, click ok.&nbsp;</p>

        <p> In the preset folder you now should see a sub-folder with the name of your chosen template, in this you will find all your downloaded presets. Simply drag and drop your chosen effect onto an asset in your timeline for it to apply the change.</p>
        <h4> <strong>Pro tips&nbsp;</strong></h4>
        <p> <strong> Backing up&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> As your template collection grows, so does its value. Mistakes can happen and so it's a great idea to periodically backup your Motion Graphics Templates folder as located in method 3.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong> Searching</strong></p>
        <p> If you’ve recently upgraded your Premiere Pro you may notice that the way in which you locate a specific template has changed. In v22.0 you now have a handy search bar option to sift through your library as well as a check box option to search your local templates only.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The libraries check box option is great for those using brand assets that are either working from a centrally located library or perhaps just a place where you like to keep everything relating to that brand separate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong> Renaming and keywording templates</strong></p>
        <p> In the essential graphics window, locate the template you wish to change using the search options. At the bottom of each thumbnail on the right hand side you will see an ‘i’ info icon, click this to open options to let you rename the template and add keywords, a great way to optimise your search results.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="title">Using Templates in Final Cut Pro X</h1>
        
        <h1>TUTORIAL: HOW TO INSTALL TEMPLATES USING FINAL CUT PRO X</h1>
        <p> Templates are professionally designed, pre-animated elements that can elevate your edit in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;They’re used by everyone from beginners to professionals who want to speed up the editing process and deliver a high production value project. In this guide we’ll take you through the easy steps to install Final Cut Pro X templates.</p>
        <p> Please note, that as Final Cut Pro X is software made for Apple Mac computers, this guide does not apply for PC users. &nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 1: Download Template</h4>
        <p> Download your template from the Videvo template library: www.videvo.net/video-editing-templates/</p>
        <p> In your downloads folder (or wherever you set your files to download to), you should see a zip file. Double click the file to un-zip it.</p>
        <h4>Step 2: Navigating to the Movies Folder</h4>
        <p> Now that you have downloaded your chosen asset next we are essentially just dragging and dropping it into the right folder so FCPX knows where it is.<br> <br> We recommend opening two finder windows and aligning them side by side. On the left open a finder window&nbsp;(<strong>Cmd+N</strong>)&nbsp;and navigate to your&nbsp;Downloads&nbsp;folder to find the chosen asset already downloaded and unzipped.</p>
        <p> On the right, open another finder window&nbsp;(<strong>Cmd+N</strong>). Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Go</strong>&nbsp;in the tool bar and select&nbsp;<strong>Home&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>Movies</strong>.</p>
        <p> Once in the Movies folder you will see the&nbsp;<strong>Motion Templates&nbsp;</strong>Folder, open this folder to reveal 4 more folders:<em>&nbsp;Effects, Generators, Titles and Transitions</em>. After this, skip to step 4. If you do not see a Motion Templates folder, don’t worry, go to step 3.</p>
        <h4>Step 3: Creating FCPX folders manually (for non Apple Motion users)</h4>
        <p> If you don’t see a Motion Templates folder in Movies then that’s just because you don’t have a program called Apple Motion on your machine. This is nothing to worry about because you do not need Motion to use Videvo templates. Instead, we just need to create the folder with its sub folders.</p>
        <p> When in the&nbsp;<strong>Movies&nbsp;</strong>folder, navigate to File&gt; New Folder in the taskbar or use shortcut&nbsp;<strong>Shift+Cmd+N</strong>.&nbsp;Call this new folder&nbsp;<em>Motion templates.localized</em></p>
        <p> When you rename this folder you’ll notice that the .localized part disappears, this is normal. The ending (extension) is essential for FCPX to find the folder so double check the spelling.</p>
        <p> Open the new Motion Templates folder and create 4 new folders inside.</p>
        <p> Rename each folder with the following:</p>
        <p> <em>Effects.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Generators.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Titles.localized</em></p>
        <p> <em>Transitions.localized</em></p>
        <p> As with before, the .localized part of the structure will disappear when you deselect the folder.</p>
        <p> Now you’re all set up to proceed to step 4.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 4: The Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p> The final stage is to simply put your downloaded template in the right folder depending on whether it is an effect, generator, title or transition. If you’re not sure what the template is then we can easily work that out by looking inside the file at the extension.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>In your&nbsp;<strong>Downloads&nbsp;</strong>folder, find the downloaded template folder.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Open the folder, if you find another set of folders, open one of them to get to the contents.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>You should see a file with the title of the template usually with a black icon next to it. Select it and use&nbsp;<strong>Cmd+I</strong>&nbsp;to bring up the info window or&nbsp;<strong>File&gt; Get Info</strong>.</li>
        <li>Looking at the Name &amp; Extension sub-heading you should see one of the following: .moef, .motn, .moti, .motr&nbsp;</li>
        <li>This extension determines where the entire folder belongs, see below:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>Files with .motr go in the transitions folder</li>
        <li>Files with .motn go in the generators folder</li>
        <li>Files with .moef go in the effect folder</li>
        <li>Files with .moti go in the titles folder</li>
        </ul>
        <p> From this, you should now know where the&nbsp;<strong>entire folder</strong>&nbsp;is going to go. To clarify, it is the entire templates folder, the whole branch that needs to be dragged and dropped into relevant folder, not the individual file we checked the extension of.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Step 5: Organising your files</h4>
        <p> Once you’ve identified where the folder will go, it’s a great time to begin organising, this will make your experience in Final Cut a lot easier.</p>
        <p> Once you’re in the relevant folder where the template belongs, before copying it over, create a new folder and call it something memorable to organise your FCPX panels for example&nbsp;<em>Videvo Templates.</em></p>
        <p> Enter the new folder (Videvo Templates) and place the templates folder here.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Finally, open Final Cut Pro X to find your brand new template in the relevant titles, generators, effects or transitions folder. Voila!&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Pro Tip:&nbsp;Renaming templates</strong></p>
        <p> If you’re finding it hard to distinguish what each template does because they are titled as sequence numbers such as: 01, 02, 03 etc in Final Cut Pro then you can easily rename the files to better represent what each asset does.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Open a finder window, click&nbsp;<strong>Go&nbsp;</strong>in the taskbar then&nbsp;<strong>Home&gt; Movies&gt; Motion Templates</strong></p>
        <p> Click into the folder of the corresponding template element then click into the sub folder such as Videvo Templates if you created one.</p>
        <p> Next, click into the folder of the element you’d like to change and find the motion extension file, this is the file which needs to be renamed in order for the title to appear in FCPX.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> For example let’s say I’m trying to rename a transition element called Bright Shake Transition.</p>
        <p> Once in the&nbsp;<strong>Motion Templates</strong>&nbsp;folder click on&nbsp;<strong>Videvo templates</strong>&nbsp;(or whatever you called this folder) click into Bright Shake Transitions. Within this folder may be several other folders, click into the first to reveal the contents. You should see a .motr file in this transition folder, this can be renamed to something more memorable such as ‘bright shake 01’. Don’t forget you can use&nbsp;<strong>Cmd+I</strong>&nbsp;to get info on the file and check the extension.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> We recommend going through each sub folder and adding your memorial text so when you open FCPX you can have a list of easily recognisable assets such as: Bright shake 01, bright shake 02, bright shake 03 and so on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Organising folders</strong></p>
        <p> We showed you how to create a subfolder titled ‘Videvo Templates’ but you could also create sub folders based on genre, project, brand or licence type. This step is really useful for professionals who may have multiple branded elements or for anyone who has an extensive library of templates.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>Creating a backup&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> As your template library grows so does its value, make sure you set reminders to back up your precious library as this Motion Templates folder sits outside of Final Cut Pro libraries and can be easily missed.</p>
        <p> <strong>Issues with using a template?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Occasionally corrupt files create caching issues which may mean your template doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to in FCPX. In this case, try deleting render files including optimised media and proxy files. When in Final Cut Pro, with the Library or Event selected in the inspector window go to File &gt; Deleted generated render files. Check ‘delete render files’, ‘delete optimised media’ and ‘delete proxy media’ and select ok.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> This does not delete your media, the files that are deleted here are ‘thinking’ files which can be re-created by FCP in the background.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="title">Installing Templates in DaVinci Resolve</h1>
        
        <h1>How to Install Videvo Templates Using DaVinci Resolve</h1>
        <p> Templates are a fantastic way to add a dynamic edge to your edit and with so many professionally designed templates out there, there’s almost no limit to what you can create.</p>
        <p> These pre-made and customisable templates can be incorporated into your own footage to create a style you can use consistently thereafter.</p>
        <p> In this guide we’ll take you through the steps to install templates in DaVinci Resolve.</p>
        <p> You can download a range of Videvo templates here: <a href="{{ url('/')}}/davinci-resolve-templates/">{{ url('/')}}/davinci-resolve-templates/</a></p>
        <p> Before get started we recommend you use the latest version of DaVinci Resolve if you run across any issues.</p>
        <h3><strong>Method 1 - Fusion Template Bundles .DRFX files</strong></h3>
        <p> If you’re using DaVinci Resolve 17 or higher and the template you’d like to install is a .DRFX file then the new way of doing this is a game changer!</p>
        <p> Simply download the template and click on the .DRFX file where a box will appear in DaVinci asking if you want to install your template. Click install and the media will appear in your Media Effects window.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;If you’re using any other file type or a previous version of Resolve, read on.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>Method 2 - Converting Macros (.settings files) into .DRFX files</strong></h3>
        <p> This sounds really complicated but I promise you it’s super simple. What we’ll do here is create a file structure, compress it, rename the extension and then kick back and relax.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 1: download your template and have your .setting files at the ready.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 2: Using your OS file explorer such as Finder, anywhere on your system, create a new folder called ‘Edit’ and enter it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Next, create 4 new sub folders called:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Titles</li>
        <li>Transitions</li>
        <li>Generators</li>
        <li>Effects&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>TIP: you only need to create subfolders for the items you’d like to place inside each template. But if you’re not sure what you need, just create all 4 for now.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Step 3: Place your .setting files loose in their relevant folder. Place .setting files that belong to Titles in the Titles subfolder, place .setting files that belong to Effects in the Effects folder and so on. If you’re unsure, you can identify what type each setting file is by looking at the Tutorial video the template came with.</p>
        <p> <strong>TIP: Don’t create or place additional subfolders in the Titles, Transitions, Generators, Effects subfolders.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Step 4: After you’ve copied everything you’d like to convert into the file structure, delete subfolders which don’t contain anything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Step 5: Navigate to the ‘Edit’ folder. With this selected, compress this folder using your OS .zip compression utility to create a .zip file of the directory structure. Rename the .zip file in your OS with the .DRFX extension instead of .zip. You can also rename Edit part to something more memorable. Now you should have a .DRFX file, double click this which will prompt DaVinci Resolve open the package contents and install- done!</p>
        <p> <strong>TIP: If you receive a warning that the .DRFX file was not imported properly, double check your file structure. Ensure the ‘Edit’ folder is zipped and that subfolders are spelt correctly.&nbsp;</strong></p>
